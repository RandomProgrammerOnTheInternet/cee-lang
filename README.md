# C==
C==, a C-style language.

### Why is it called C==?
Uh, there's C++, and there's C#, which is C++++, since # is like 4 plusses. So, I decided to do the same thing. C-- is a thing, so C---- must be C==, because one = sign is the same as 2 minuses.

Runs on x86/64 Linux. Requires GNU ld and nasm.

Currently very barebones.

### Usage
```
./ceec <file_name>
./a.out
```
currently being rewritten
